# Personal Website - [Link Here](https://billw.space)

## My first major project after learning some few front end languages.

<br>

### I was able to gain hands-on experience with:

> - Styling webpage elements with CSS
> - Structuring the webpage with HTML classes and divs
> - Creating animations with CSS/JavaScript
> - Debugging JavaScript scripts
> - Front-end UI design

<br>

### This website was built from scratch using plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

<br>

### Enjoy!
