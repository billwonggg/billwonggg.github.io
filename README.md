# **Old Personal Website** - [_Link Here_](https://billwonggg.github.io)

> ### This is my first personal project after learning some front-end languages.

#### This website was built from scratch using plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript, with no libraries.

> #### I was able to gain first hand experience with:
>
> - Structuring the webpage information with HTML elements
> - Styling webpage elements with CSS
> - Creating animations with CSS/JavaScript, which interacts with mouse-clicks and mouse-hovers
> - Debugging JavaScript functions
> - Front-End UI design
