# Personal Website

My first major project after learning a few front end languages.

This website was built from scratch using plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

I was able to gain a lot of hands-on experience with
* Styling webpage elements with CSS
* Structuring the webpage with HTML classes and divs
* Creating animations with CSS/JavaScript
* Debugging JavaScript scripts
* Front-end UI design

Enjoy!
