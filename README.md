# **Personal Website** - [_Link Here_](https://billw.space)

> ### My first project after learning some front end languages.

### This website was built from scratch using plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

> ### I was able to gain hands-on experience with:
>
> - Styling webpage elements with CSS
> - Structuring the webpage with HTML classes and divs
> - Creating animations with CSS/JavaScript
> - Debugging JavaScript scripts
> - Front-end UI design
